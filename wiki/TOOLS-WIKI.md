## Git

Storing Git credentials is way more complicated than I thought, there is some options:

- Github CLI (not working like I want)
- Git Credential Manager (designed for Windows so complicated on Linux)
- Git cache, but each time cache expires we should generate new token, because Github does not allow usage of password to login
- Git plain text, not very secure, even if it's a token

The only simple and secure solution I found is using git-credential-oauth
