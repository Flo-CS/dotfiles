## Two options

### 1 - Classic dotfiles

First install:
- Fork repo (for me I will create new branch)
- Run install.sh if it's first time or if you just want to update packages or whatever config

Update:
- Just sync the fork and resolve conflicts if any
- Run again install.sh or config.sh

Advantages:
- Update is customizable, and changes are shown to the user, no migrations overhead
- User is not tied up to a "distro", he can just eject it if he want (is it true ?)

Inconvenients:
- Update may have conflicts

### 2 - "Distro" experience

First install:

Update:

Advantages:
- Installation flow is pretty clear, it just looks like a "distro" installation, like a ready to use system

Inconvenients:
- Update of the copied config folder at first install is not in sync with the "distro" repo. Is it an inconvenient ?
- Migrations can't resolve all divergent changes, for example, in case of a software change (e.g. node.js to bun), we can't just uninstall node.js, what for the users who still want to use it ? Using the first option, at least user can see the changes and choose what to do (?)
